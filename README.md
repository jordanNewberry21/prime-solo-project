# Creations by Casey

*Creations by Casey* is the name of a small DIY vintage business based in Faribault, MN. I was hired by the business owner to create their online store, to help get their new business off the ground. This website is currently still in production. I created this website for my client as part of my curriculum at [Prime Digital Academy](https://primeacademy.io/). This is my final solo project application.

## Start Up

If you want to open this app up on your computer, all you need to do is clone down the git repository, and run an `npm install` in the terminal. Then run `npm run server` in one terminal, and then in another terminal in the same directory run `npm run client` to open it in the browser and you're good to go.

    - Express
    - React
    - Axios

## Acknowledgement
