          I’m Kay Williams, owner and artist of Creations by Casey. Casey is a nickname that comes from my Mom, it’s a hybrid of some sort. A combination of Kay and my middle name Sue. She took creative license with my name, runs in the family.
          I have been a registered nurse for almost 30 years. I know three of the best adults who I get to claim as my children and I have two wonderful grandchildren.
          I have many creative interests. Some, like decorating cakes, I learned out of necessity.  As a young family, the “fancy” store bought cakes were not in the budget. I now take requests from and decorate for my granddaughters, I’ve gotten good at decorating rainbow unicorn cakes. Jewelry making, card making, memory albums and quilting. I just enjoy creating; it’s like doing yoga, therapeutic.   
          My favorite past time is painting, mostly wood and mixed media pieces. I save furniture and other items that were well loved by their former owners and get them ready for a whole new life.
          So glad that you have found me.
